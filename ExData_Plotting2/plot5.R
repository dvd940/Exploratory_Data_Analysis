# Plot 5: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
# Note: for the purpose of this excercise, the data was taken to be any data with "veh" in the Short.name.

# This script requires that the following files be in the working directory

# summarySCC_PM25.rds
# Source_Classification_Code.rds
#
# These files can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip

# This code requires the following packages:- 
#
# dplyr
# ggplot2

# If not already installed, install these using the install.packages function.

# Load libraries
library(dplyr)  # for summarise() and group_by() functions.
